Flymake for the CMake build system
==================================

These are scripts for using the [CMake build system](http://www.cmake.org/) with [Flymake](http://flymake.sourceforge.net/), an on-the-fly syntax checker for GNU Emacs. I've found these [scripts](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Flymake_help) written by Nil Geisweiller on the OpenCog Wiki, but they didn't work immediately for me. I'm trying to make them work out of the box. I was linked to them by [Flymake with CMake on the EmacsWiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlyMake#toc6).

Dependencies
------------

These scripts require a few obvious dependencies.

* [Emacs 23](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), which includes Flymake (this is not necessary to run the script, but to use the results)
* [GNU bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)

Installation
